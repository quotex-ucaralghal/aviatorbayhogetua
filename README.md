In this article, we will discuss the concept of halal investing and
whether Quotex meets the criteria. We will also provide a step-by-step
guide on how to start trading with Quotex.

## Is Quotex Halal?

The answer to the question of whether Quotex is halal is not a simple
yes or no. There are a number of factors that need to be considered,
such as the type of trading offered by the platform, the underlying
assets, and the risk involved.

Binary options trading is a type of derivative trading in which the
trader bets on the future price of an asset. If the trader\'s prediction
is correct, they will profit. If the prediction is incorrect, they will
lose their investment.

Some scholars argue that binary options trading is haram because it
involves gambling. Gambling is prohibited in Islam because it is seen as
a form of risk-taking that is not based on skill or knowledge.

However, other scholars argue that binary options trading is halal if it
is done in a way that minimizes risk. For example, a trader could only
trade with a small amount of money that they can afford to lose. They
could also use a trading strategy that is based on technical analysis or
fundamental analysis.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not Quotex is halal is a personal
one. Traders should consult with their own religious advisor to get
guidance on this matter.
